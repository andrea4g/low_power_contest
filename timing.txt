ARGUMENTS
       -to to_list
              Reports  only the paths to the named pins, ports, or clocks.  If
              you do not specify the -to option, the default is to report  the
              longest  path to an output port if the design has no timing con-
              straints.  If the design has timing constraints, the default  is
              to  report  the path with the worst slack within each path group
              if the -group option is not present.  If the  -group  option  is
              given,  the  default  is to report the path with the worst slack
              within the group specified by the -group option.

       -rise_to rise_to_list
              Same as the -to option, but applies only to paths rising at  the
              endpoint.   If  a clock object is specified, this option selects
              endpoints clocked by the named clock, but only  the  paths  cap-
              tured  by  the  rising edge of the clock at clock source, taking
              into account any logical inversions along the clock path.

       -fall_to fall_to_list
              Same as the -to option, but applies only to paths falling at the
              endpoint.   If  a clock object is specified, this option selects
              endpoints clocked by the named clock, but only  the  paths  cap-
              tured by the falling edge of the clock at the clock source, tak-
              ing into account any logical inversions along the clock path.

       -from from_list
              Reports only the paths from the named pins,  ports,  or  clocks.
              If you do not specify the -from option, the default is to report
              the longest path to an output port if the design has  no  timing
              constraints.   If the design has timing constraints, the default
              is to report the path with the  worst  slack  within  each  path
              group if the -group option is not present.  If the -group option
              is given, the default is to report the path with the worst slack
              within the group specified by the -group option.

       -rise_from rise_from_list
              Same  as  the  -from option, except that the path must rise from
              the objects specified.  If a clock  object  is  specified,  this
              option  selects startpoints clocked by the named clock, but only
              the paths launched by the rising edge of the clock at the  clock
              source,  taking  into  account  any logical inversions along the
              clock path.

       -fall_from fall_from_list
              Same as the -from option, except that the path  must  fall  from
              the  objects  specified.   If  a clock object is specified, this
              option selects startpoints clocked by the named clock, but  only
              the paths launched by the falling edge of the clock at the clock
              source, taking into account any  logical  inversions  along  the
              clock path.

       -through through_list
              Reports  only  paths that pass through the named pins, ports, or
              clocks.  If you do not specify the -through option, the  default
              is  to  report  the longest path to an output port if the design
              has no timing constraints.  If the design does have timing  con-
              straints, the default is to report the path with the worst slack
              within each path group if the -group option is not present.   If
              the  -group  option  is given, the default is to report the path
              with the worst slack within the group specified  by  the  -group
              option.

              If  you  specify  the  -through  option  only one time, the tool
              reports only the paths that travel through one or  more  of  the
              objects  in  the list.  You can specify the -through option more
              than one time in one command invocation.  For  a  discussion  of
              the  use  of multiple -through options, see the DESCRIPTION sec-
              tion.

       -rise_through rise_through_list
              Reports only paths with a rising  transition  at  the  specified
              objects.   This  option  is similar to the -through option.  You
              can specify the -rise_through option more than  one  time  in  a
              single   command  invocation.   For  a  discussion  of  multiple
              -through, -rise_through,  and  -fall_through  options,  see  the
              DESCRIPTION section.

       -fall_through fall_through_list
              Reports  only  paths  with a falling transition at the specified
              objects.  This option is similar to the  -through  option.   You
              can  specify  the  -fall_through  option more than one time in a
              single  command  invocation.  For  a  discussion   of   multiple
              -through,  -rise_through,  and  -fall_through  options,  see the
              DESCRIPTION section.

       -exclude exclude_list
              Prevents reporting of all data paths from/through/to  the  named
              pins, ports, nets, and cell instances. Any data path that starts
              from, contains, or ends on a  listed  object  is  excluded  from
              reporting.   If  you  specify  a  cell instance, data paths that
              include any pin of that cell instance are excluded. This  option
              has higher precedence than the -from, -through, -to, and similar
              options.

              The exclusion does not apply  to  clock  paths,  even  when  the
              -path_type  full_clock  or -path_type full_clock_expanded option
              is  used.  It  does  not  apply  to  borrowing  path  from   the
              -trace_latch_borrow option.

              This option is not applied to clock pins.

       -rise_exclude rise_exclude_list
              Same as the -exclude option, but applies only to paths rising at
              the named pins, ports, nets, and cell instances.

       -fall_exclude fall_exclude_list
              Same as the -exclude option, but applies only to  paths  falling
              at the named pins, ports, nets, and cell instances.

       -path_type short | full | full_clock | full_clock_expanded | only | end
              Specifies  how to display the timing path.  By default, the full
              path is displayed.  The following values are valid:

               o If full_clock is specified, the  report  is  similar  to  the
                report you get with full but also reports the full clock paths
                for propagated clocks.

               o If full_clock_expanded is specified, the report is similar to
                the  report  you get with full_clock but also reports the full
                clock path from the primary clock  to  the  related  generated
                clock source.

               o  If  short  is  specified, only startpoints and endpoints are
                displayed.

               o If only is specified, only the path is displayed without  the
                accompanying required-time and slack calculation.

               o  If  end  is  specified,  the report has a column format that
                shows one line for each path, showing only the  endpoint  path
                total, required-time, and slack.

       -delay_type min | min_rise | min_fall | max | max_rise | max_fall
              Specifies the path type at the endpoint.  The default is max.

       -nworst paths_per_endpoint
              Specifies  the  maximum  number of paths to report per endpoint.
              The default is 1, which reports only the single worst path  end-
              ing at a given endpoint.

       -max_paths max_path_count
              Specifies  the  number  of  paths  to  report  per path group by
              default, or the number of paths to report for the  whole  design
              if  the  timing_report_fast_mode  variable  is  set to true. The
              default is 1.

       -input_pins
              Shows input pins in the path report.  The  default  is  to  show
              only output pins.  This option also shows the delays of the nets
              connected to these pins.

       -nets  Shows nets in the path report.  The default is not to show nets.
              To show the delay for the nets, use the -input_pins option.

       -transition_time
              Shows  the  net transition time for each driving pin in the path
              report.  The default is not to show the net transition time  for
              each driving pin.

       -crosstalk_delta
              Shows  the  delta  delay  for each input pin in the path report.
              The default is not to show the delta delay for each input pin.

       -capacitance
              Causes the total (lumped) capacitance to be shown  in  the  path
              report.   The  default  is  not  to  show capacitance.  For each
              driver pin, the total capacitance driven by the driver  is  dis-
              played  in  a  column  preceding both incremental path delay and
              transition time (specified with  the  -transition_time  option).
              When  the  -nets option is specified, the capacitance is printed
              on the lines with nets instead of the lines with driver pins.

       -effective_capacitance
              Causes the effective capacitance for  nets,  calculated  by  the
              Arnoldi  method, to be shown in the path report. For each driver
              pin, the worst effective capacitance among  all  of  the  driver
              arcs  is  displayed  in  a column labeled "Ceff". When the -nets
              option is used, the effective capacitance is shown in the  lines
              reporting  the  nets,  rather than the driver pins. Only capaci-
              tance values calculated by the Arnoldi method are shown  in  the
              "Ceff"  column;  where  capacitance  is  calculated  by  another
              method, the "Ceff" column is left blank.

       -attributes
              Shows the attributes specified in  the  timing_report_attributes
              variable.  The  supported  attributes  are dont_touch, dont_use,
              map_only, infeasible_paths  (for  the  Design  Compiler  and  DC
              Explorer  tools),  size_only for cells, dont_touch for cells and
              nets, and ideal_net for nets.

       -physical
              Shows the locations of the pins and the capacitive loads for the
              pins  and nets in the path report.  The loads are displayed as a
              pair of values with the first value being the  wire  capacitance
              of  the  net  and  the  second value being the total capacitance
              driven by the driver.  If the pin location cannot be determined,
              the cell location is displayed, with the coordinates in microns.

       -slack_greater_than greater_slack_limit
              Specifies that only  those  paths  with  a  slack  greater  than
              greater_slack_limit are to be reported.  This option can be com-
              bined with -slack_lesser_than to report only those paths  inside
              or outside a given slack range.

       -slack_lesser_than lesser_slack_limit
              Specifies   that  only  those  paths  with  a  slack  less  than
              lesser_slack_limit are to be reported.  This option can be  com-
              bined with -slack_greater_than to report only those paths inside
              or outside a given slack range.

       -lesser_path max_path_delay
              Selects only those paths with a delay less than  max_path_delay.
              Combine this option with the -greater_path option to select only
              those paths inside or outside a given delay range.

       -greater_path min_path_delay
              Selects  only  those   paths   with   a   delay   greater   than
              min_path_delay.   Combine  this  option  with  the  -lesser_path
              option to select only those paths  inside  or  outside  a  given
              delay range.

       -loops Reports only the timing loops in the design.

       -enable_preset_clear_arcs
              Enables  asynchronous  timing arcs for this report.  By default,
              asynchronous timing arcs are disabled during all timing  verifi-
              cation.   This  option  allows  you to see the timing with these
              arcs enabled.  Only the current report is affected.

       -significant_digits digits
              Specifies the number of digits to the right of the decimal point
              to  report.   Allowed values are from 0 through 13.  The default
              is 2.   Using  this  option  overrides  the  value  set  by  the
              report_default_significant_digits variable.

       -nosplit
              Prevents  line  splitting and facilitates writing application to
              extract information from the report output.  Most of the  design
              information  is  listed in fixed-width columns.  If the informa-
              tion in a given field exceeds the column width, the  next  field
              begins on a new line, starting in the correct column.

       -sort_by group | slack
              Specifies  the  order  in  which  the  paths  are reported.  The
              default -sort_by key is group.  By default, paths are sorted  by
              costing  groups.   Within  each  group, the paths are ordered by
              slack.  With slack, the paths are ordered by slack only.

       -group group_name
              Specifies the path group from which timing  paths  are  selected
              for reporting, based on other specified options for reports.  If
              the -group option is not specified, the  reported  paths  are  a
              subset  of  paths  from  all path groups.  This option cannot be
              used with the -loops option.

       -trace_latch_borrow
              Controls the type of report generated for a path that starts  at
              a  transparent  latch.   If the path startpoint borrows from the
              previous stage, using this option causes the report to show  the
              entire  set  of  borrowing  paths  that lead up to the borrowing
              latch, starting with  a  nonborrowing  path  or  a  noninverting
              sequential  loop.   By  default,  the report shows only the last
              path in  the  sequence  of  borrowing  stages.   Each  stage  is
              reported  separately, showing the time borrowed and lent and the
              endpoints of the stage.  The cumulative amount of borrowed  time
              along  a  sequence of stages is not included in the report.  The
              -input_pins, -nets, -transition_time, -capacitance, and -signif-
              icant_digits  options  apply  to  every stage in the sequence of
              borrowing paths, but the remaining options (for example,  -from)
              apply only to the last stage reported.

       -derate
              Prints  timing derate values for each path element.  By default,
              no derate value is printed.  When this option is specified,  the
              -input_pins  and  -nets  options  are  automatically  turned on.
              Input delay and ideal clock network latency is not derated.

       -normalized_slack
              Paths are gathered and sorted using normalized slack instead  of
              slack.   Normalized  slack  divides  the  slack  by an idealized
              allowed propagation delay.  In order to  use  this  option,  you

              malized_slack variable set to true.

       -scenarios scenario_list
              Reports each  scenario  in  the  list  separately,  with  up  to
              -max_paths paths reported for each scenario.  Inactive scenarios
              are skipped in the report.  If this option is  not  given,  only
              the current scenario is reported.

       -temperature
              Reports  the  operating condition temperature for each path ele-
              ment for multivoltage designs.

       -voltage
              Reports the operating condition voltage for  each  path  element
              for  multivoltage  designs.  When  the operating condition for a
              macro, switch, or pad cell is inferred from other library cells,
              a  tilde character (~) is displayed next to the voltage value in
              the timing report.

       -unique_pins
              Causes only the single  worst  timing  path  through  any  given
              sequence of pins to be reported. No other paths are reported for
              the same sequence of pins from startpoint to endpoint. For exam-
              ple,  if  the  worst path starts with a rising edge at the first
              pin of a pin sequence, then paths starting with a  falling  edge
              are  not reported for that sequence. For non-unate logic such as
              XOR gates, this greatly reduces the  number  of  paths  reported
              because of the large number of possible rising/falling edge com-
              binations through the sequence of pins. Using  this  option  can
              require  longer  runtimes  when  used  with the -nworst n option
              because many paths must be  analyzed  to  find  the  worst  path
              through  each  pin sequence, but only the worst path is reported
              and counted toward the total number of requested paths.

       -start_end_pair
              Limits reporting to the single worst timing path per each combi-
              nation  of  startpoint  and  endpoint  found. No other paths are
              reported that have the same startpoint and  same  endpoint.  For
              example, if the worst path starts at a register clock pin ff1/CK
              and ends at a register input pin ff5/D,  the  report  omits  all
              other  less  critical  paths  from  ff1/CK  to ff5/D. Using this
              option can require longer runtimes when used with the -nworst  n
              option  because  many  paths  must be analyzed to find the worst
              path through each pin pair, but only the worst path in each case
              is  reported  and  counted  toward the total number of requested
              paths.

       -variation
              Reports the mean and standard deviation of the statistical  time
              increment  for  each  path  element. This option works only when
              parametric on-chip variation (POCV) analysis has been enabled by
              setting  the  timing_pocvm_enable_analysis variable to true.  By
              default, statistical parameters are not reported.

       -ignore_infeasible_paths
              Ignores all paths flagged as infeasible during the latest compi-
              lation.

DESCRIPTION
       The  report_timing  command provides a report of timing information for
       the current design.  By default, the report_timing command reports  the
       single worst setup path in each clock group.

       The  command  options let you specify the number of paths reported, the
       types of paths reported, and the  amount  of  detail  included  in  the
       report.   You  can restrict the scope of paths reported by startpoints,
       endpoints, and  intermediate  points  by  using  the  -from,  -to,  and
       -through   options;   and   by  slack  or  clock  group  by  using  the
       -slack_lesser_than and -group options.

       The timing report starts by showing the primary command settings, oper-
       ating  conditions, path startpoint, path endpoint, path group name, and
       path timing check type (max for a setup check, min for  a  hold  check,
       and so on).

       A  table  in  the  report shows point-by-point accounting of the delays
       along the path from the startpoint to the endpoint.  The default  table
       has  columns  labeled  Point,  Incr,  and Path.  These columns list the
       points (cell pins) along the path, the incremental contribution to  the
       delay at each point, and the cumulative delay up to that point, respec-
       tively.  Hierarchical boundary crossings are listed  as  well,  showing
       zero  incremental  delay  at each crossing.  You can optionally display
       net delays in the report by using the -input_pins option and net  names
       by using the -nets option.

       The  symbols  "r"  and "f" in the Path column indicate the sense of the
       signal transition, either rising or falling, at that point in the path.

       For  a setup check, the path starts with the launch clock edge and ends
       at the data input of the capture device.  The data arrival  time  shown
       in  the  table  is  the  amount  of elapsed time from the source of the
       launch clock edge to the arrival of data at the endpoint,  taking  into
       consideration the longest possible delays along the path.

       Following  this  is  the accounting for the required arrival time.  The
       data required time shown in the table is the latest  allowable  arrival
       time for the data at the path endpoint, taking into account the nominal
       capture clock edge time, the clock  network  delay,  the  clock  uncer-
       tainty,  the least possible delay along the clock path, and the library
       setup time requirement for the capture device.

       The slack value shown at the end of the report  is  the  data  required
       time  minus  the data arrival time.  This represents the amount of time
       by which the timing constraint is met.

       Back-annotations on path elements in the timing path are indicated by a
       character  symbol  in  the  Incr  column.  If the -input_pins option is
       used, each pin-to-pin delay spans either a net  or  cell.   The  symbol
       shown refers to the dominant annotation on each path element.  (Certain
       annotations dominate others; for example,  SDF  takes  precedence  over
       back-annotated RC parasitics.)

         Symbol     Annotation
         ------     ----------
         ^          Ideal network latency annotation
         *          Back-annotation using SDF or preroute Elmore extraction
         &          RC network back-annotation using Elmore delay calculation
         #          Estimated delay for high-fanout net
         z          Zero delay due to set_zero_interconnect_delay_mode
         <none>     Wire-load model or none

       You  can  use  multiple -through options in a single command to specify
       paths that traverse multiple points in the design.  The following exam-
       ple  specifies  paths beginning at A1, passing through B1, then through
       C1, and ending at D1:

         prompt> report_timing -from A1 -through B1 -through C1 -to D1

       If more than one object is specified within one  -through  option,  the
       path can pass through any of the objects.  The following example speci-
       fies paths beginning at A1, passing through either B1 or B2, then pass-
       ing through either C1 or C2, and ending at D1:

         prompt> report_timing -from A1 -through {B1 B2} -through {C1 C2} -to D1
       Creation  and  usage  of  scenarios  is  available with Design Compiler
       Graphical.

   Multicorner-Multimode Support
       By default, this command uses information from  the  current  scenario.
       You can select different scenarios by using the -scenarios option.  The
       only exception is the clock object, which only comes from current  sce-
       nario.
