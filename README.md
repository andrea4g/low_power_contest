# Low Power Contest

The low power contest is a project made for the "Synthesis and Optimization of 
Digital Systems" course @ Polytechnic of Turin.
The aim of the project is to reduce the leakage current, hence the power compsuntion, of a generic digital circuit.
To do this the main technique used has been the "dual-Vth".
The cells not in the critical path have been switched with others characterized by an higher threshold voltage, in this way the leakage has been reduced.
The proposed solution is able to select whitch percentage of cells change.
Furthermore it is possible to select whenever the algorithm can modify the critical path or not.
